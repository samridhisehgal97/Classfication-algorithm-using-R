Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that impairs an individualâ€™s body to process blood glucose, known as blood sugar. Inadequate supervision of diabetes causes stroke, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. By exploiting the advantages of the advancement in modern sensor technology, IoT, and machine learning techniques, I have proposed an approach for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes in this Report. The primary objective of this study is twofold. First, to classify diabetes into predefined categories, Second, for the predictive analysis of diabetes . I have employed three widely used classifiers, i.e., LDA, QDA,KNN and logistic regression.
